We developed xbrlware as process automation tool for financial institutions. We recently shifted our focus from "automation products for financial institutions" to "communication products for enterprises" and decided to fully focus  on communication technologies for enterprises. Hence looking for suitable acquirer for xbrlware assets.

## Why are we selling it? ##

Xbrlware is more of a consulting business. As a company we would like to focus on SaaS based business than consulting business. Since we are located outside US/Europe, SaaS business is more appropriate for us to scale & grow when compared to consulting business. All of our existing customers approached us after seeing/using our open source version. We felt that if we were located in US/Europe, we could have acquired more customers and generated greater revenue. We realized that in consulting business proximity to customer base is very important. We tried to create SaaS business around XBRL, but that didn't work out.

## What traction does xbrlware has? ##

xbrlware has good global traction & brand value. xbrlware community edition has been adopted by users from 65+ countries.

## How does xbrlware compare with other offerings in XBRL space? ##
Most offerings are focused on helping customers to file XBRL documents. We are focused on automation of analysis of those financial filings.

xbrlware helps clients to roll out custom analytics solutions fast. We developed xbrlware as API and plugin based product rather than a particular solution (such as report generation / DB export etc). xbrlware will allow clients to create & orchestrate their own solutions for their needs.

xbrlware also supports semantic aware financial facts retrieval ( http://code.google.com/p/xbrlware/wiki/RDFSupport )

## Does xbrlware work with non-US feeds, say Gemany? or Spain? or UK? ##
xbrlware implements xbrl spec 2.1. So it can analyze filings that uses 2.1 spec. xbrlware is used for analyzing
  * SEC - US GAAP based filings.
  * FDIC (http://www.ffiec.gov/)  . See case study at http://code.google.com/p/xbrlware/wiki/CaseStudy#Analyzing_financial_facts_of_FDIC_insured_institutions

One of our user from Moscow using xbrlware to analyze IFRS based filings with multiple linkbases.

If you throw any xbrl 2.1 documents  (from spain, china or any other country) to xbrlware, it should work.

Typically Taxonomy definitions differ from country to country. If you prefer to retrieve taxonomy details along with financial facts,
  * Download taxonomies for a particular country.
  * Generate Taxonomy program class file that represents taxonomy details    via xbrlware taxonomy generation tool by passing taxonomy files from step 1 as parameter.
  * Ask xbrlware use this taxonomy. (See http://code.google.com/p/xbrlware/wiki/UsingDifferentTaxonomyOfinterest )
